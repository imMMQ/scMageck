\arguments{
  \item{BARCODE}{
A txt file to include cell identity information, generated from the cell identity collection step.
}
  \item{RDS}{
A Seurat object or local RDS file path that contains the scRNA-seq dataset. Note that the dataset has to be normalized and scaled.
}
  \item{NEGCTRL}{
The name of the genes (separated by ",") served as negative controls.
}
  \item{SELECT_GENE}{
The list of genes for regression. By default, all genes in the table are subject to regression. 
}
  \item{LABEL}{
The label of the output file.
}
  \item{PERMUTATION}{
The number of permutations for p value calculation.
}
  \item{SAVEPATH}{
The save path of result. Default save path is the current working directory. If you don't need save the result, set SAVEPATH as NULL.
}
  \item{LAMBDA}{
A paramter for the LR model.
}
  \item{GENE_FRAC}{
A paramter for filtering low expressed genes.
}
