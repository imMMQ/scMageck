%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{BARCODE}{
A txt file to include cell identity information, generated from the cell 
identity collection step.
}
  \item{RDS}{
A Seurat object or local RDS file path that contains the scRNA-seq dataset. 
Note that the dataset has to be normalized and scaled.
}
  \item{NEGCTRL}{
The name of the genes (separated by ",") served as negative controls.
}
  \item{SELECT_GENE}{
The list of genes for regression. By default, all genes in the table are 
subject to regression. 
}
  \item{LABEL}{
The label of the output file.
}
  \item{PERMUTATION}{
The number of permutations for p value calculation.
}
  \item{SAVEPATH}{
The save path of result. Default save path is the current working directory. 
If you don't need save the result, set SAVEPATH as NULL.
}
  \item{LAMBDA}{
A paramter for the LR model for ridge regression. Default: 0.01.
}
  \item{GENE_FRAC}{
A paramter for filtering low expressed genes. By default, only genes 
that have expressions in at least that fractions of cells are kept. Default: 0.01.
}
  \item{SIGNATURE}{
A GMT text file, the format must be as follows:(1)Column 1: name of gene set; 
(2)Colum 2: Empty, or the information about gene set e.g. the source of the gene set; 
(3)Column 3 and onwards: ids of genes beloging to a particular gene set. 
Note that this parameter for applying LR model for the gene set analysis.
