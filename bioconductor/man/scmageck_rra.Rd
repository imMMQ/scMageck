}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{BARCODE}{
A txt file to include cell identity information, generated from the cell identity collection step.
}
  \item{RDS}{
An R RDS file of Seurat object containing the scRNA-seq dataset. Note that the dataset has to be normalized and scaled.
}
  \item{GENE}{
Genes whose expressions are to be tested. Multiple genes can be provided, separated by ",". For example, "MKI67,TP53"
}
  \item{RRAPATH}{
The path to the RRA program, if RRA cannot be found in the PATH environment variable.
}
  \item{LABEL}{
The label of the output file.
}
  \item{NEGCTRL}{
The name of the negative control gene. For example, "NonTargetingControlGuideForHuman". Default is NULL (do not use any negative controls).
}
  \item{KEEPTMP}{
Keep temporary files.
}
  \item{PATHWAY}{
Treat genes in --GENE option as a pathway. In other words, the averaged expression of these genes will be used for testing.
}
