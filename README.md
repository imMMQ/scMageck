# scMAGeCK [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/217109402.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/217109402)

scMAGeCK is a computational model to identify genes associated with multiple expression phenotypes from CRISPR screening coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing data (CROP-seq).

scMAGeCK is based on our previous [MAGeCK](http://mageck.sourceforge.net) and MAGeCK-VISPR models for pooled CRISPR screens. The scMAGeCK manuscript can be found at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/658146v1/).

# Installation

You can install scMAGeCK R package by following steps. We will submit the R package to Bioconductor soon.

## Method 1: download and install directly from bitbucket

First, download scMAGeCK R source code from [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/weililab/scmageck/downloads/scMAGeCK_0.99.12.tar.gz) tab.

Second, in the command line (if you are using RStudio, open your RStudio and click on the "Terminal" tab which is next to the Console tab), type the following command:

    cd scMAGeCK_package_folder
    
    R CMD INSTALL scMAGeCK_0.99.12.tar.gz

Note: "R CMD install" may not work; use "R CMD INSTALL".

## Method 2: install through bioconductor

    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

    # The following initializes usage of Bioc devel
    BiocManager::install(version='devel')

    BiocManager::install("scMAGeCK")

PS: an executable file is also required by RRA function and it can be generated by following commands:

    wget https://bitbucket.org/weililab/scmageck/downloads/RRA_0.5.9.zip
    
    unzip RRA_0.5.9.zip
    
    cd RRA_0.5.9
    
    make

## Dependencies 

scMAGeCK depends on the following softwares or packages, all available via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel.

* [MAGeCK](https://mageck.sourceforge.net)
* pysam
* R 
* [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)

To install these dependencies via bioconda, install miniconda (Python v3) first (see instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), then use the following command:

    conda create -n scmageck -c bioconda mageck pysam r-seurat
    
This will create an environment named "scmageck" that includes all dependencies. Use the following command to activate this environment:

    source activate scmageck

Sometimes Seurat may not be installed successfully using bioconda. If this is the case, follow the instructions of [Seurat installation](https://satijalab.org/seurat/install.html).


# Demos

## Demo 1: running scMAGeCK from known single cell identity

This demo provides a mini example to run both modules of scMAGeCK: RRA and LR. 

In RStudio, open the file *scmageck_rra_demo.R* or *scmageck_lr_demo.R*. Then press *Ctrl + Enter* to run all lines of the script or click *Run* tab to run line by line.

In the terminal, type

    Rscript scmageck_rra_demo.R  

or

    Rscript scmageck_lr_demo.R

to run both demos.

# Output files

## scMAGeCK-RRA

scMAGeCK-RRA will output the ranking and p values of each perturbed genes, using the RRA program in MAGeCK. Users familiar with the MAGeCK program may find it similar with the [gene_summary](https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/output/#gene_summary_txt) output in MAGeCK.

Here is the example output of scMAGeCK-RRA:

    Row.names       items_in_group.low      lo_value.low    p.low   FDR.low goodsgrna.low   items_in_group.high     lo_value.high   p.high  FDR.high        goodsgrna.high
    TP53    271     0.11832 0.95619 1       48      271     1.014e-83       4.9975e-06      0.00015 184

Explanations of each column are below:

|Column|Content|
|------|-------|
|Row.names| Perturbed gene name|
|items_in_group.low| The number of single-cells with each gene perturbed |
|lo_value.low | The RRA score in negative selection (reducing the marker expression if this gene is perturbed). The RRA score uses a p value from rank order statistics to measure the degree of selection; the smaller score, the stronger the selection is. More information on the calculation of RRA score can be found in our original [MAGeCK](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4) paper. |      
|p.low  | The raw p-value (using permutation) of this gene in negative selection  |  
|FDR.low | The false discovery rate of this gene in negative selection |
|goodsgrna.low | The number of single-cells that passes the threshold and is considered in the RRA score calculation in negative selection|
|items_in_group.high| The same as items_in_group.low: the number of single-cells with each gene perturbed) |
|lo_value.high| The RRA score in positive selection (increasing the marker expression if this gene is perturbed|      
|p.high| The raw p-value (using permutation) of this gene in positive selection  |  
|FDR.high| The false discovery rate of this gene in positive selection |
|goodsgrna.high| The number of single-cells that passes the threshold and is considered in the RRA score calculation in positive selection|


## scMAGeCK-LR

scMAGeCK-LR will generate several files below:

|File|Description|
|----|----------|
|_score.txt|The score (similar with log fold change) of each perturbed gene (rows) on each marker gene (columns)|
|_score.pval.txt|The associated p values of each score|
|LR.RData|An R object to store scores and p values|

The format of score.txt and score.pval.txt is a simple table file with rows corresponding to perturbed genes and columns corresponding to marker genes. For example in the score.txt,

    Perturbedgene        APC     ARID1A    TP53    MKI67
    APC     0.138075836476524       -0.0343441660045313     0.214449590551132       -0.150287676553705


This row records the effects of perturbing APC gene on the expressions of APC, ARID1A, TP53 and MKI67.

This file can also be imported directly into R (using read.table). 


## cropseq_count (cell identity)

The output of cell identity contains a single text file below:


    cell    barcode sgrna   gene    read_count      umi_count
    AAATCAACGGGTGA-1        NF1_sg_118      AGTCAGTACTGAGCACAACA    NF1     1187    30
